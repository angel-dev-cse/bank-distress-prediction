# Bank Distress Prediction

## Description
Developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood of bank distress using machine learning algorithms based on Performance Matrix and compared the result with previously established z-score method.

## Techniques and Tools
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering,
- Modesl: gradient boosting, adaboost, SVM, logistic regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree and CNN.
- Tools: Python (pandas, scikit-learn).

## Results
Achieved an accuracy of 97.56% with a recall of 98% in identifying distressed banks (random forest, SVM, decision tree, CNN) based on performance matrix. For z-score it falls around 50%. From this we can understand previously established approach solely based on z-score is insufficient in detecting if a bank is in finanacial distress or not.

## Usage
